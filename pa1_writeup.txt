1. (3pts) In your own words, how does the insert method in SinglyLinkedList.java differ from the add method?

In the if statment in instert method is checks in index is equal to 0. If it is we make a new node
attached to head. This new node has the first part be the element and the next part be head.

In else The method insert makes will create an integer variable called "currentIndex" that equals
0. The while loop it uses also is based on going until "currentIndex" is bigger than index that's
minused by 1. Each while loop execution also adds one to "currentIndex". After the while lop we
also set next part of current (which we made equal to head) to a new node which the first part is
the element we got from insert and the second part is the next in current.

Add of the other had has it's while loop go until the next in current is equal to null. In each
while loop execution we make current equal to current.next. Then after the while loop we make the
next in current equal to a new node where the first part is the element given in the method and
the second part is null.

2. (3pts) In your own words, how does the remove method in SinglyLinkedList.java differ from the pop method?

In the pop method we first declare an empty element which we will call "element". This is not done
for remove. The if statement for remove only defines head as head.next, which will change the head
point to the next node. The if for pop method does the same, but before it in the if statement we
also make it so the element variable we defined in it is the element part, or number part, of the
head.

The else statement of pop and remove are very similar. But for pop, after the while loop, we make
element varaible equal to the element in next, speicfically the next in current.

After our loops, for the remove method qe only subtract size by 1, for the pop method we subtract
size AND return element.

3. (4pts) ArrayList.java contains a non-constructor method that SinglyLinkedList.java does not.
What is this method, and why might it appear in ArrayList.java but not SinglyLinkedList.java?

ArrayList.java contains the non-constructor method "resize" which SinglyLinkedList.java does not.
This is most likely because arraylists are dynamic, you can add and remove items in the arraylists
and the arraylists will automatically resize itself. However, linkedlists do not resize
automatically themselves. So we have to do it manually and thus create a function.
