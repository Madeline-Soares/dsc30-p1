1. (1pt) Approximately how long did you spend on this PA?
I spent around 3 hours on this. However I was ill, so it may have taken longer.

2. (3pt) What is something that you think you did well on this PA?
I think I did really well with the Node part, especially with the setting. I feel confident with my
abilities in that.
3. (3pt) What is something that you struggled with on this PA?
I heavily struggled with things that involved the head and tails variables. I belive this is because I kept confusing
them with next and prev variables for some reason.
4. (1pt) Would you rather have done PA 0 and PA 1 together in one assignment, or did it help you to have them as separate assignments?
I would have rather done them seperate.
